## Validator Testing

- HTML: while testing my index.html file through the official <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a>. it discovered an error on line 164 of my code which was a result of putting the script tag outside the body tag.  ![w3c-validator](assets/Pictures//w3c-validtor.JPG)
However I have fixed the error and the validator confirmed that I have no errors or warning to show.
